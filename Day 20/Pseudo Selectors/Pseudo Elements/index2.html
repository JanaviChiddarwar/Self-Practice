      For those who are interested in finding random paragraphs, that's exactly
      what this webpage provides. If both a random word and a random sentence
      aren't quite long enough for your needs, then a random paragraph might be
      the perfect solution. Once you arrive at this page, you'll see a random
      paragraph. If you need another one, all you need to do is click on the
      "next paragraph" button. If you happen to need several random paragraphs
      all at once, you can use this other paragraph generator. Below you can
      find a number of ways that this generator can be used. The doll smelled

      slammed his fists into it. Stupid fucking Peter, he thought as he landed a
      solid roundhouse kick. Stupid alphas and their stupid fucking ruts, he
      thought as he practiced some knee and elbow strikes. Stupid omega biology,
      he thought—and nearly broke Brian’s nose when he came up behind him
      without warning.
